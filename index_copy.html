                                      Program Description:
This program is an extension of the previous programs, for which there is a description of
how files are being read in, how shading was done, and how various transformations were accomplished.
This program adds on additional functionality:

Read in multiple objects and fit them all in the canvas

Left click to select an object

Translate with left click down + drag

Rotate with right click + drag

Scale with middle click + scroll

Maneuverable point light source added by default, select it with left click,
move it with left click down + drag

Specular Lighting toggle, and shininess slider


                                Notes to grader:
-Probably only works in google chrome

-Works best with frame and enterprise.

-Specular light is very overpowering for some reason, implemented slider bar but specular lighting
 is strong even at shininess = 1, so it is hard to tell

-Careful scrolling the point light source, it moves quickly
