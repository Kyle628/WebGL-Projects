This program reads in two files, a .coor and a .poly file. The coordinates from .coor
are read into an array vertarr[]. The same is done for the .poly file into pgons[],
while also calculating the normal vector to each polygon and storing this info in a
new array polynorms[].

Then, for every polygon in Pgons, it is figured out what triangles will be drawn and
what vertices these triangles require. Then we grab the the appropriate vertices from
vertarr[] and append them to a new array triarr[]. From vertarr, we build up a 4x4
matrix of what transformations will need to be applied to each vertex. With all this
info set up properly, we make all the webgl calls, and display whatever object was
described in the files. The transformations are applied in the Vshader, and all of
the shading calculations happen in the Fshader.

As of now, the program is not working perfectly, but works best with the frame example,
and chair1
