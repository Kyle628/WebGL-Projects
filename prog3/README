                                Controls:

Left click to select an object (including point light)

Translate with left click down + drag

Rotate with right click + drag

Scale with middle click + scroll

                                Notes to grader:
-Probably only works in Google Chrome

-Works best with frame and enterprise.

-Specular light is very overpowering for some reason, implemented slider bar but specular lighting
 is strong even at shininess = 1, so it is hard to tell

-Careful scrolling the point light source, it moves quickly
